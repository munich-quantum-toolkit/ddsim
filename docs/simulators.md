# Simulators

DDSIM offers different kinds of simulators to use. The following documentation
gives an overview of the different simulator followed by brief demonstrations of
the usage in Python and as standalone executable.

All simulators immediately, or with steps in between, inherit from the abstract
{cpp:class}`Simulator` class that provides basic functionality used by multiple
actual simulators.
