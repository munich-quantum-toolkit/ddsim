# Qiskit Primitives

The existing Qiskit interface to backends (`backend.run()`) was originally designed to accept a list of circuits and return counts for every job. Over time, it became clear that users have diverse purposes for quantum computing, and therefore the ways in which they define the requirements for their computing jobs are expanding.

To address this issue, Qiskit introduced the `qiskit.primitives` module in version 0.35.0 (Qiskit Terra 0.20.0) to provide a simplified way for end users to compute outputs of interest from a QuantumCircuit and to use backends. Qiskit's primitives provide methods that make it easier to build modular algorithms and other higher-order programs. Rather than simply returning counts, they return more immediately meaningful information.

The two currently available primitives are the `Sampler` and the `Estimator`. The first one computes quasi-probability distributions from circuit measurements, while the second one calculates and interprets expectation values of quantum operators that are required for many near-term quantum algorithms.

DDSIM provides its own version of these Qiskit primitives that leverage the default circuit simulator based on decision diagrams, while preserving the methods and functionality of the original Qiskit primitives.

## Sampler

+++

The [`Sampler`](#mqt.ddsim.primitives.sampler.Sampler) implements the Qiskit [`BaseSamplerV2`](#qiskit.*.BaseSamplerV2) interface. It takes a list of `QuantumCircuit` objects and simulates them using the `CircuitSimulator` from MQT DDSIM. It then computes the quasi-probability distributions of the circuits in the list and encapsulates the results, along with the job's metadata, within a [`PrimitiveResult`](#qiskit.*.PrimitiveResult) object.

Furthermore, it also handles compilation and parameter binding when working with parametrized circuits.

Here, we show an example on how to use this submodule:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

from mqt.ddsim.primitives import Sampler

# Parametrized circuit to create an X-gate
theta_a = Parameter("theta_a")
circ = QuantumCircuit(1)
circ.ry(theta_a, 0)
circ.measure_all()

# Show circuit
circ.draw("mpl")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Initialize sampler
sampler = Sampler()
```

The `run()` method accepts an iterable of PUB-like objects, where PUB stands for primitive unified bloc. In the example below, the PUB comprises the circuit and an array of parameter values, where the latter is optional. For more information, see Qiskit's [`StatevectorSampler.run()`](#qiskit.*.StatevectorSampler.run). The number of shots can be set as an additional argument. If not, the default value is 1024.

```{code-cell} ipython3
pubs = [(circ, [np.pi])]
shots = int(1e4)
job = sampler.run(pubs, shots=shots)
result = job.result()
```

The `result()` method of the job returns a [`PrimitiveResult`](#qiskit.*.PrimitiveResult) object. This object contains a [`SamplerPubResult`](#qiskit.*.SamplerPubResult), which, in turn, contains the necessary information to compute the quasi-probability distribution. It furthermore contains job metadata.

```{code-cell} ipython3
bit_array = result[0].data["meas"]
probabilities = {key: value / shots for key, value in bit_array.get_counts().items()}

print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Quasi-probability distribution: {probabilities}")
```

It is also possible to simulate multiple circuits in one job:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Create a second circuit
circ_2 = QuantumCircuit(1)
circ_2.measure_all()
circ_2.draw("mpl")
```

In this case, we have two PUB-like objects.

```{code-cell} ipython3
job = sampler.run([(circ, [np.pi]), circ_2], shots=int(1e4))
result = job.result()

bit_array_1 = result[0].data["meas"]
probabilities_1 = {key: value / shots for key, value in bit_array_1.get_counts().items()}

bit_array_2 = result[1].data["meas"]
probabilities_2 = {key: value / shots for key, value in bit_array_2.get_counts().items()}

print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Quasi-probability distribution for circuit 1: {probabilities_1}")
print(f"  > Quasi-probability distribution for circuit 2: {probabilities_2}")
```

Now, let us use the [`Sampler`](#mqt.ddsim.primitives.sampler.Sampler) on a more complex circuit. For this example, we will test Grover's algorithm on a 4-qubit circuit where the marked states in the binary representation are "0110" and "1010".

A similar implementation of Grover's algorithm using Qiskit's sampler can be found here: <https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/grovers-algorithm>

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Built-in imports
import math

# Qiskit imports
from qiskit.circuit.library import MCMTGate, GroverOperator, ZGate
from qiskit.visualization import plot_distribution

# Define an oracle circuit that marks the input states, which are represented as a list of bitstrings
def grover_oracle(marked_states: list) -> QuantumCircuit:
    if not isinstance(marked_states, list):
        marked_states = [marked_states]
    # Compute the number of qubits in circuit
    num_qubits = len(marked_states[0])

    qc = QuantumCircuit(num_qubits)
    # Mark each target state in the input list
    for target in marked_states:
        # Flip target bit-string to match Qiskit bit-ordering
        rev_target = target[::-1]
        # Find the indices of all the '0' elements in bit-string
        zero_inds = [ind for ind in range(num_qubits) if rev_target.startswith("0", ind)]
        # Add a multi-controlled Z-gate with pre- and post-applied X-gates (open-controls)
        # where the target bit-string has a '0' entry
        qc.x(zero_inds)
        qc.compose(MCMTGate(ZGate(), num_qubits - 1, 1), inplace=True)
        qc.x(zero_inds)
    return qc

# Enter the states to be marked
marked_states = ["0110", "1010"]
oracle = grover_oracle(marked_states)
oracle.draw("mpl")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Build circuit that amplifies the marked states by the oracle
grover_op = GroverOperator(oracle)
grover_op.decompose().draw("mpl")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Compute the optimal number of repetitions of the GroverOperator to amplify the probabilities of the marked states
optimal_num_iterations = math.floor(math.pi / 4 * math.sqrt(2**grover_op.num_qubits / len(marked_states)))

# Build the full Grover circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(grover_op.num_qubits)
# Create even superposition of all basis states
qc.h(range(grover_op.num_qubits))
# Apply Grover operator the optimal number of times
qc.compose(grover_op.power(optimal_num_iterations), inplace=True)
# Measure all qubits
qc.measure_all()
qc.draw("mpl")
```

After having built the circuit, use the [`Sampler`](#mqt.ddsim.primitives.sampler.Sampler) to get the probability distribution.

```{code-cell} ipython3
result = sampler.run([qc], shots=int(1e4)).result()
bit_array = result[0].data["meas"]
probabilities = {key: value / shots for key, value in bit_array.get_int_counts().items()}
plot_distribution(probabilities)
```

## Estimator

+++

The [`Estimator`](#mqt.ddsim.primitives.estimator.Estimator) calculates the expectation value of an observable with respect to a certain quantum state (described by a quantum circuit). It implements the Qiskit [`BaseEstimatorV2`](#qiskit.*.BaseEstimatorV2) interface. However, in contrast to Qiskit's estimator, the DDSIM version exactly computes the expectation value using its simulator based on decision diagrams instead of sampling.

The [`Estimator`](#mqt.ddsim.primitives.estimator.Estimator) also handles parameter binding when dealing with parametrized circuits.

Here, we show an example on how to use it:

+++

First, we build the observable and the quantum state. The observable is given as a [`SparsePauliOp`](#qiskit.*.SparsePauliOp) object, while the quantum state is described by a `QuantumCircuit`.

In this example, our observable is the Pauli matrix $\sigma_{x}$ and the quantum state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit import Parameter
from qiskit.quantum_info import Pauli

from mqt.ddsim.primitives.estimator import Estimator

# Build quantum state
circ = QuantumCircuit(1)
circ.ry(np.pi / 2, 0)
circ.measure_all()

# Build observable
pauli_x = Pauli("X")

# Show circuit
circ.draw("mpl")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Initialize estimator
estimator = Estimator()
```

The next step involves running the estimation using the `run()` method. Just like the `run()` method of the [`Sampler`](#mqt.ddsim.primitives.estimator.Sampler), it accepts an iterable of PUB-like objects. In the example below, the `QuantumCircuit` object representing the quantum state and an array of [`SparsePauliOp`](#qiskit.*.SparsePauliOp) objects representing the observable. If the circuit is parametrized, we would also pass an array of parameters. For more information, see Qiskit's [`StatevectorEstimator.run()`](#qiskit.*.StatevectorEstimator.run).

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Enter observable and circuit as a sequence
job = estimator.run([(circ, [pauli_x])])
result = job.result()
```

The `result()` method of the job returns a [`PrimitiveResult`](#qiskit.*.PrimitiveResult) object. This object contains a [`PubResult`](#qiskit.*.PubResult), which, in turn, contains the computed expectation values.

```{code-cell} ipython3
expectation_values = result[0].data["evs"]

print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Expectation values: {expectation_values}")
```

Now we explore how the [`Estimator`](#mqt.ddsim.primitives.estimator.Estimator) works with multiple circuits and observables. For this example, we will calculate the expectation value of $\sigma_{x}$ and $\sigma_{y}$ with respect to the quantum state $|1\rangle$. Since our observable list has a length of 2, we need to enter two copies of the `QuantumCircuit` object representing $|1\rangle$ as a sequence:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Build quantum state
circ = QuantumCircuit(1)
circ.ry(np.pi, 0)
circ.measure_all()

# Build observables
pauli_x = Pauli("X")
pauli_y = Pauli("Y")


# Construct pub
pub = (circ, [pauli_x, pauli_y])

# Run estimator
job = estimator.run([pub])
result = job.result()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
expectation_values = result[0].data["evs"]

print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Expectation values: {expectation_values}")
```

The first and second entries of the list of values are the expectation value of $\sigma_{x}$ and $\sigma_{y}$, respectively.

+++

Let us now calculate the expectation values of $\sigma_{x}$ with respect to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)$. For this example we will use parametrized circuits to build the quantum state.

```{code-cell} ipython3
theta = Parameter("theta")
circ_2 = QuantumCircuit(1)
circ_2.ry(theta, 0)
circ_2.measure_all()

# Show circuit
circ_2.draw("mpl")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Construct pub
pub = (circ_2, [pauli_x], [[np.pi / 2], [-np.pi / 2]])

# Run estimator
job = estimator.run([pub])
result = job.result()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
expectation_values = result[0].data["evs"]

print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Expectation values: {expectation_values}")
```
